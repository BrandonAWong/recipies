  <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chicken katsu (chicken cutlet (Japanese: チキンカツ, Hepburn: chikinkatsu)), also known as panko chicken, or tori katsu (torikatsu (鶏カツ)) is a Japanese dish 
        of fried chicken made with panko bread crumbs which is also popular in Australia, Hawaii, London, California, and other areas of the world.</p>
    <p>Chicken katsu is generally served with tonkatsu sauce (とんかつソース), a thick Japanese vegetarian pureed fruit-based brown sauce, or a well-seasoned ketchup, 
        as a Hawaiian mixed plate lunch meal. It is generally served with shredded cabbage, rice or miso soup as part of a two or three item combo, or as a dinner 
        with rice and vegetables.</p>
    <p>In Hawaii, chicken katsu is as common as tonkatsu (pork cutlets). It is also served in place of tonkatsu in katsu curry and katsudon in local plate-lunch 
        restaurants and in fine-dining Japanese establishments alike. It is often served in the form of a sandwich with "tonkatsu sauce".</p>
    
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - pounded to 1/2 inch thickness</li>

      <li>Season the chicken breasts on both sides with salt and pepper. Place the flour, egg and panko crumbs into separate shallow dishes.
